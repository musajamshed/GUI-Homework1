            <h1>Cars</h1>
            <p>A lot of the time, when somebody says they "like cars" they usually mean the act of actually driving a car. While I do enjoy driving, I also love cars for their unqiue styles, advanced features, and incredible performance (even if I'm not the one driving). When we first got our licenses, my brother and I used to go to car dealerships just to walk around the lot and check out the different models they had even though we knew we weren't going to be buying one yet. Fast forward to today and we've both been fortunate enough to be able to buy and sell some of our favorite cars. My favorite luxury car brand is Mercedes and my favorites for sports cars are Lamborghini, McLaren, and Porsche.</p>
