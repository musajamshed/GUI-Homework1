            <h1>Traveling</h1>
            <p>I don't recall exactly when I declared traveling as an officail hobby of mine, but maybe that's because I've always loved to explore new areas along with the things that they have to offer. Before we had a driver's license, my brother and I would go biking around our town with our friends and even into New Hampshire since we live close to the border. When we started driving, those biking trips became road trips to New York, New Jersey, etc. Once my parents trusted me to fly on my own, I took advantage and went to Los Angeles, California with my cousin. Most recently, I explored several countries in Europe this past summer with the same cousin. There's just something interesting about seeing how the world is different in certain places and how the people/culture in those places are different as well.</p>
