            <p>My name is Musa Jamshed. I am a senior at UMass Lowell with a major of Computer Science (I transferred to UML from UMass Amherst). I was born in Boston and have lived in Massachusetts my whole life, however, my family is from Pakistan. I have a wide variety of work experience for various reasons. First, my high school had a work-study program where they matched each student up with corporate jobs in an industry of their interest that we would go to and work one day a week. Then, I was able to get several independtly arranged internships with big companies during my time in college. Also, I have completed a co-op through UML's Professional Co-op Program. I also like to volunteer whenever I get the chance. After I graduate college, I plan to work for a few years and then eventually open my own company.</p>
