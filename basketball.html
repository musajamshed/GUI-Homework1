            <h1>Basketball</h1>
            <p>I vividly remember the first time I watched an NBA game on TV. My brother and I were supposed to be sleeping since I believe it was a school night, but we were sneaky enough to turn the TV on with the volume off so our parents wouldn't find out. It was the 2011 NBA Finals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Miami Heat. My brother and I both instantly fell in love with the sport and it soon became our favorite sport. Our hometown Boston Celtics became our favorite team. Our parents bought us a basketball hoop and put it in our driveway where we would practice our skills and get better over time. We joined our local youth in-town league and played until we were in high school. During high school, we joined a YMCA league. Eventually, I also starting coaching in the youth in-town league. The story kind of came full circle last year when I signed a contract for an internship with the Boston Celtics after having volunteered for the team's charity foundation for several years. My friends and I still volunteer to this day and are rooting for the team's 18th championship banner to arrive sooner rather than later.</p>
