            <h1>Family Time</h1>
            <p>My family is a close-knit one and we all like spending time with each other. Whether it's an activity at home or going out and exploring what the world has to offer both locally and abroad. Most of my extended family lives in Pakistan so that's part of the reason why my parents and siblings are so close to each other. My father is a first generation immigrant to the US as he came here to complete his undergrad at the University of Arizona. After graduating, he got married to my mom and accpeted a job offer in Cambridge, MA. My mom is an elementary school substitute teacher. I owe my parents a lot of credit for any success that I obtain since it's made possible by the sacrifices they made early on in their lives and some they still continue to make to this day (including being so far away from their family in Pakistan). We usually visit Pakistan every other summer and it's always a fun experience, however, it's a very long journey to actually get there. The exact travel time depends on which airline and/or route you take, but in general it's about a 20 hour journey door to door.</p>
