            <p>I was always more on the "tech savvy" as a kid and I guess it's carried over to the point where I chose Computer Science as my major in college. I had a strong curiousoity of and fascinated with computers, video games, mobile phones, and most other forms of technology. My brothers and I have certainly played our fair share of video games growing up amongst ourselves and also with friends online. The first phone I had was a flip phone, then I got a Samsung, and now I don't think I'll ever buy any other phone besides an iPhone. Same thing goes for laptops/MacBooks.</p>
